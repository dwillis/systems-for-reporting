#### Exercises

  * Using the [Sunday talk show guest data](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheUpshot/Sunday-Shows/master/guests.csv), find how many times Bernie Sanders appears. Then use a [pivot table](http://www.gcflearnfree.org/office2013/excel2013/27) to calculate the total number of appearances by each person on the list.
  * Let's put some of it on the Web, starting with [this gist](http://bl.ocks.org/ndarville/7075823) and [this file](https://analytics.usa.gov/data/live/all-pages-realtime.csv) from [analytics.usa.gov](https://analytics.usa.gov/). We'll check it out on [bl.ocks.org](http://bl.ocks.org/).
  * Pulling data from the web: Using the [Maryland Attorney General's office](http://www.oag.state.md.us/Press/index.htm) and [Import.io's Magic](https://magic.import.io/examples) (you'll need to sign up for a free account). Let's turn that list of press releases into CSV and JSON data (first using [Mr. Data Converter](https://shancarter.github.io/mr-data-converter/)).
