  * Scraping: in your first-web-scraper/scrapers directory, create a new folder called `sports` and inside it create a new `scrape.py` file. Adapt one of your earlier scrapers to grab [the list of Washington Nationals transactions](http://m.mlb.com/was/roster/transactions/) here. The output file should be called `transactions.csv` and should have the following headers: date, url and text. That means you'll need to find the link inside each row and extract it. Google is your friend, and specific googling like "scraping urls in beautiful soup" is even better. Push your scrape.py file and your transactions.csv file to your repository, and email me a couple of sentences describing any issues you see with the output (or you can try to solve them in the script, too).
