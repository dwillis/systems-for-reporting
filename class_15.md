### Assignments

  * PDFs: take [this file](http://files.peacecorps.gov/university-rankings/2017/topschools2017.pdf) of top Peace Corps volunteer-producing schools and, using [Tabula](http://tabula.technology/) (installing it if you haven't already), draw boxes around the schools, their rankings and number of alumni volunteers so that you can create a single CSV file with the following headers: category (values of large, medium or small), rank, college, volunteers. Save that CSV file in  your exercises repository and push it to Github. Need help? Check the "How to Use Tabula" section [here](http://tabula.technology/). Then, send me by email a story idea based on this data, one in which the data plays a big part. For reference, see [other stories](https://www.google.com/search?aq=2&oq=peace+corps+college&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8&q=peace+corps+college+rankings#q=peace+corps+college+rankings&tbm=nws&*) about these rankings.
