### Assignments for April 11

  * Mapping: Take the Fairfax Arrests file (which is in your `agate_exercises` directory, or [here](https://github.com/SMPA3193/agate_exercises/blob/master/arrest.csv)), and upload it to Fusion Tables. Make sure that the Address field is a "Location" field (use the Edit -> Change Columns drop down menu to check) and then geocode the file using that Address field. Visualize the results on a map and then click the "Share" button at the top right and enter my email (dwillis@gwu.edu) in the Add People box.
  * Group updates: commit/push or email them by April 11.
