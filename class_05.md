#### Assignments for March 2

  * Read [Finding Data](http://mjwebster.github.io/DataJ/Other/FindingData.pdf)
  * Read [Ideas by Beat](http://mjwebster.github.io/DataJ/Other/Ideasbybeat.html)
  * Read [Distrust Your Data](https://source.opennews.org/en-US/learning/distrust-your-data/)
  * Each project team should create a new repository called "team_{team number}" in [our class GitHub organization](https://github.com/JOUR479K), where {team number} is your [team's number](https://github.com/orgs/JOUR479K/teams). In that repository upload a text file containing at least three ideas for topics/beats you might want to focus on for your projects. You don't have to be expansive, but please put more than, say, "Food" or "Crime." Give as much detail as you can. A final project might involve 1-3 sets of data (or more), so don't feel limited to a single thing.
