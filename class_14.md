### More Scraping

  * Picking up where we left off with our congress scraper - let's fix that party/state thing.

### Discussion

  * NYT: [Second Avenue Subway Relieves Crowding on Neighboring Lines](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/01/nyregion/second-avenue-subway-relieves-crowding-on-neighboring-lines.html)

### Assignments for March 28

  * Scraping: [Columbian College faculty research grants](https://columbian.gwu.edu/2015-2016). In your first-web-scraper/scrapers directory, create a new folder called `college` and, inside it, a file called `scrape.py`. Let's adapt our previous Congress or crime scraper to pull the information from the research grants table and write out a CSV file, but with a twist: let's not just do 2015-2016, but back to 2010-2011 as well, and add a column for the academic year. Remember, we're doing the same thing for each of those pages, so try not to repeat blocks of code.
  * Project Updates: Due by Tuesday, pushed to Github. Tell me what your group has done/decided this week and what it plans to do next week. If you have a pressing question or issue, email me.
  * Install [http://tabula.technology/](http://tabula.technology/) on your laptops.
