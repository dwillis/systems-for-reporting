### More Scraping

  * Picking up where we left off with our congress scraper - let's fix that party/state thing.
  * [Columbian College faculty research grants](https://columbian.gwu.edu/2015-2016). Let's adapt our previous scraper to pull this information and write out a CSV file, but with a twist: let's not just do 2015-2016, but back to 2010-2011 as well. Remember, we're doing the same thing for each of those pages, so try not to repeat blocks of code.

### Discussion

  * NYT: [Second Avenue Subway Relieves Crowding on Neighboring Lines](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/01/nyregion/second-avenue-subway-relieves-crowding-on-neighboring-lines.html)
