#### Assignments for Jan. 26

  * Sorting and filtering using [analytics.usa.gov](https://analytics.usa.gov/data/) data.
  * One more data modeling exercise, with a twist: take the [play-by-play from GW's women's basketball game on Jan. 21](http://www.gwsports.com/sports/w-baskbl/stats/2016-2017/gm19um.html#GAME.PLY) and, using the events from the beginning (9:47) to the 7:18 mark, try to model the data in a CSV file (that's using Excel, but *save the file as a CSV file type*). First row is a header - you choose the columns - and the subsequent rows are for data. Try to fit all the different kinds of events in. You don't have to use the terms the play-by-play uses; feel free to come up with your own. Ideally, we want one event on one row, so that might mean you need multiple rows for the same timestamp. Add the CSV file (called `playbyplay.csv`) to your Github exercises repository.
