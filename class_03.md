  * Sorting and filtering using [analytics.usa.gov](https://analytics.usa.gov/data/) data. Download the CSV file of "[Visits to all domains over 30 days](https://analytics.usa.gov/data/live/all-domains-30-days.csv)" and open it in Excel. Sort the data so that you can find which domain had the highest value for "avg_session_duration" and which domains had more than 100 "pageviews_per_session". Use a filter to find out how many NASA domains saw at least 100,000 visits. Put the answers to all of these into a text file (answers.txt) and upload it and the saved CSV file to your Github repository that you created today. Email dwillis@gwu.edu with the link to your GitHub repository. If something goes wrong, email the files directly to me.
  * Reading: [Automating Transparency](https://source.opennews.org/en-US/learning/automating-transparency/). We'll talk about this.
