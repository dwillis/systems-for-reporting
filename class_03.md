#### Exercises

  * Using the [Web Frequency Indexer](http://www.lextutor.ca/freq/eng/) and Excel, calculate the frequency of words used in the ["I Have a Dream" speech](http://www.americanrhetoric.com/speeches/mlkihaveadream.htm). Upload the Excel file to GitHub.
  * Let's visualize that using [in-cell bar graphs](http://infosthetics.com/archives/2006/08/excel_in_cell_graphing.html).


#### Assignments for Feb. 17

  * Using the text of this [2009 Senate speech by Sen. Jim Inhofe](http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/22/senate-section/article/s9648-2/), calculate the frequency of words used. Copy the results into Excel. Then do an in-cell bar chart like we did in class, using the REPT() function, and calculate the percent of total words that each word represents. Upload the Excel file to your "exercises" repository.
  * One more data modeling exercise, with a twist: take the [play-by-play from Tuesday's men's basketball game](http://www.umterps.com//ViewContent.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=29700&CONTENT_ID=1649162) and, using the events from the beginning (19:45) to the first media timeout (15:50), try to model the data in a CSV file (that's using Excel, but *save the file as a CSV file type*). First row is a header - you choose the columns - and the subsequent rows are for data. Try to fit all the different kinds of events in. You don't have to use the terms the play-by-play uses; feel free to come up with your own. Ideally, we want one event on one row, so that might mean you need multiple rows for the same timestamp. Add the CSV file (called `playbyplay.csv`) to your Github exercises repository.
