### Course Information

#### Office Hours & Communication

I plan to be at Knight Hall by 2 p.m. most Wednesdays, so will be available between 2-3 p.m. and then immediately after class, and by appointment. The very best way to reach me is by email; if you have a question, doubt, concern or cat picture to share, email me. I will make every attempt to notify students should our schedule change.

#### About the Instructor

I have worked as a journalist since 1995, when I secured [an internship offer from The Palm Beach Post](http://dwillis.net/image/42295553170) against a dozen rejections from [some](http://dwillis.net/image/42289385513) [of](http://dwillis.net/image/42283024010) [the](http://dwillis.net/image/42282077315) [finest](http://dwillis.net/image/42281381971) news organizations in the country. Somehow, I went on to work for some of them: Congressional Quarterly, [The Center for Public Integrity](http://www.publicintegrity.org/authors/derek-willis), [The Washington Post](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/05/04/AR2005050402393.html), [The New York Times](http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/w/derek_willis/index.html) and now [ProPublica](https://www.propublica.org/site/author/derek_willis). Although it may appear that I have trouble keeping a job, I mostly have moved to chase new opportunities, especially those involving data and the Internet. This is why I teach: because as many issues as journalism has, it has so many opportunities. My skill is not as a writer or interviewer, but I love finding stories in data, and making that process easier. My Internet claim to fame is that I was named "Wanker of the Day" by liberal blogger Atrios for [Jan. 17, 2006](http://www.eschatonblog.com/2006/01/wanker-of-day_17.html). I am not a [University of Kentucky basketball player](http://www.ukathletics.com/sport/m-baskbl/2015/roster/559d907be4b01c7eefd5ec97), but I do like basketball (and have season tickets to women's basketball). If you'd like somebody else's take on me, [here's one](http://radar.oreilly.com/2012/03/profile-of-the-data-journalist-1.html).

#### Prerequisites

You must have completed a university statistics course, and have some experience with a spreadsheet. You will need a comfort for installing software on your own personal computer (we'll do this together), for trying new things and for making mistakes. Our goal is to make [creators, not just users](http://thescoop.org/archives/2013/10/01/the-natives-arent-restless-enough/).

#### Technology

In addition to working on computers in the lab, you will need to have a computer (Mac, Linux or Windows, preferably a laptop). You must have the ability to install software on this computer. The tools we will use will include: Excel/Google Spreadsheets, SQLite, Python and JavaScript.

#### Textbooks and Readings

There are no textbooks for this course. We will have regular readings chosen from professional work, government documents and other sources. You will be expected to read materials before class and to discuss them in class. Post any questions you might have about a reading to the class’s GitHub project as an issue and flag it appropriately so it can be resolved in advance or discussed in class.

### Course Description and Goals/Learning Outcomes

This course will teach students how to use data and technology to craft a systematic approach to beat reporting, or to build what you could call a reporter’s exoskeleton. Such a system would make it easier for a journalist to place news in context or spot interesting and potentially newsworthy events.

As an example of this, consider the Supreme Court: each ruling is in itself a potential story and also one part of the life of a changing institution that draws on previous cases and is influenced by judges' past and present actions. Being able to place a ruling in context -- is this out of character for this court, or for any Supreme Court in history? -- is a valuable skill for a journalist. Collecting the information needed to provide this context can also help the journalist produce better questions and ideas. That collection effort is rarely simple, but advances in technology make it possible in a variety of circumstances.

Students will work with some of the tools for building system for reporting: spreadsheets, databases, pattern matching and some programming, including web scraping and building useful but simple sites for reporting. Students will work in small teams to choose a beat, research data sources around it and develop a web-based system to surface useful and unusual aspects of the data. You will be doing some work that qualifies as "computer programming" in this course, but it is not a programming course. This is a course about using computers and software to make you a better journalist.

Students will learn to create and deploy simple tools and systems that could be evaluated and used by journalists at the university and in the professional world. These could range from tools that capture and broadcast key information from government data to simple Web sites that make it easier to compare changes over time or data from different geographic areas. Some examples:

  * [Mentions of ProPublica in Congressional Record](http://dwillis.github.io/paper-of-record/?apikey=474754a0d230cc71b31b8bf6d313b70c&notify=false)
  * [Itemizer](https://projects.propublica.org/itemizer/)
  * [Extract Text from a URL](http://extractor.herokuapp.com/)
  * [Find Tweets about a news article](http://tweetrewrite.herokuapp.com/)
  * [SCOTUS_Servo](https://twitter.com/SCOTUS_servo)

The other, more important, goal is that students leave the course with an idea of how to use technology to approach a beat in a systematic manner.

The course will proceed on two tracks: in class we'll learn about and practice using techniques and tools, and outside class you will work in small groups on projects throughout the semester, with regular updates to the class. Your homework mainly will consist of readings and project work.

### Assignments and Grading

Grading will be based on the following activities.

*Participation - 10 percent*

You are expected to contribute to in-class discussions, as well as group work in class. Journalism isn't a passive activity, and thinking of questions is literally a core skill for any journalist. If you aren't questioning things or exploring things, this might not be the profession for you.

*Assignments and quizzes - 30%*

There will be in-class and the occasional take-home skills-based assignments and quizzes. These are individual assignments, although you can ask your colleagues for help on work done outside class. There will be 10 quizzes, which means we won't have them every week, but I won't tell you in advance (because it's a _quiz_). Each student's lowest grade from these assignments will be dropped in determining the final grade; you may want to preserve this option for emergencies. The remaining assignments will be averaged for this portion of the final grade.

*Biweekly project assessments - 20%*

Beginning on Feb. 10, I will grade your group project's progress every two weeks, based on materials groups will submit on their GitHub page. These include background research, prototype work, code and design.

*Final project - 30%*

Your final project, which should be a working, deployed application for the Web (or a Web-enabled service like Twitter), is due at the end of the course. It represents the entirety of your project work.

*Peer assessments - 10%*

Twice during the semester, your fellow group members will be asked to provide an assessment of your contributions to the group's progress. The first evaluation, which will be around the midpoint, will not be graded but you will receive their comments anonymously to help you know how you are doing. The second, due at the end of the course, will be graded. On both occasions, you also will provide a self-evaluation.

There is *no final exam* for this course; groups will present their final projects.

### Course Policies

#### Attendance

Journalism is not a passive activity and requires focus, inquisition and involvement. Every week, we will be discussing our own work (and others) and we will be building a set of skills to use, and I expect your comments, questions and other contributions to our class. None of this can happen if you don’t show up, and your participation grade will suffer as a result.

If you are ill and will miss class, let me know before that class, if possible. Unless you have my approval in advance, course work cannot be made up if you do not submit it on time.

There will be no major assignments scheduled on religious holidays identified by the university. If you expect to miss a class due to a religious holiday, please notify me in writing before the start of the second class.

#### Inclement weather

  If the university closes due to foul weather (snow, ice, hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes) or other emergencies and class must be canceled, students will be advised of assignment adjustments by the instructor. We will likely use our class site to make these notifications and/or conduct a virtual class. Please check the [university's home page](http://umd.edu/) if in doubt about whether or not classes have been canceled on campus.

#### Etiquette

*Respect:* You should treat your classmates with respect. I'll expect this both in your verbal communication with them but also in your non-verbal communication. This means: pay attention and be empathetic.

*Computers:* When we are using computers, I expect that you will be using the program that we are talking about and not surfing the Web or checking email. I recommend that you take notes by hand, which [can be more effective than on a computer](http://pss.sagepub.com/content/25/6/1159).

*Teamwork:* You will be assigned to a team of five students to work on your final project, not only to enable a broad range of perspectives but to help each other understand the concepts introduced in readings and in-class work. Each member of the group will be required to submit a self-evaluation and to evaluate the other members of the group; these evaluations will influence each student's final project grade.

*Academic integrity:* Along with certain rights, students have the responsibility to behave honorably in an academic environment. Academic dishonesty, including cheating, fabrication, facilitating academic dishonesty and plagiarism, will not be tolerated. Adhering to a high ethical standard is of special importance in journalism, where reliability and credibility are the cornerstones of the field. Therefore, the college has adopted a “zero tolerance” policy on academic dishonesty. Any abridgment of academic integrity standards in a College of Journalism course will be referred to the university's [Student Honor Council](http://www.shc.umd.edu/) and the college’s deans. To make sure this is understood, all students are asked to sign an academic integrity pledge at the beginning of the semester that will cover all assignments in this course. Students found to have violated the university's honor code may face sanctions, including a grade of XF for the course, suspension or expulsion from the university. I will be asking you to sign the university's [Academic Integrity Pledge](http://merrill.umd.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/AcademicIntegrityPledge.pdf) during the first class.
