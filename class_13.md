  * Final Projects: All teams will present their work next week in class, but teams may choose to submit their final projects anytime between May 4-11. Teams should push the entirety of their work - any notes, drawings, scripts, data or other files - to their GitHub accounts by 3 p.m. on May 11. Late assignments will be reduced by a full letter grade. Also due by 3 p.m. on May 11 are the self and peer evaluations. I will email you those documents, which need to be emailed back to me.
