### Assignments for Feb. 21

  * In your local Terminal or PythonAnywhere console, finish the exercise we started today, picking up [here](https://github.com/dwillis/smpa3193-exercises/blob/master/01-reading-csv-files.md#working-with-an-online-csv-file). Run the `pip` command from the bash shell, then start a Python session. After you run through it the first time, change the commands so that you filter on the name "ELIJAH" like we did with Irene.
  * Try to walk through the exercise described [here](https://github.com/dwillis/smpa3193-exercises/blob/master/02-agate-exercise.md). It will look different because you when you run `juypter notebook` it will launch a browser locally and you'll type your commands (and run them) in that rather than the Terminal. Don't worry too much if you run into issues; email me!
  * Reading: [Mockingjay](https://source.opennews.org/articles/mockingjay/)
  * Project ideas: Remember the ideas you sent me? Try to think of a potential data source about one or both of them that you could analyze, and email that to me along with what you think the focus could be. For example: "I really like cricket, and I was thinking about using the [Cricsheet](http://cricsheet.org/) data to see which batting partnership has been the most productive in Test matches." Try to be more specific.
