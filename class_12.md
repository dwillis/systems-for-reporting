### Buzzfeed on Bernie


### Agate Exercise

  * [County population estimates](https://github.com/dwillis/smpa3193-exercises/blob/master/04-agate-exercise.md)

### Assignment for March 2

  * Background on [Adam Harris](https://www.clippings.me/adamharris), our guest speaker who will talk about using social platforms for reporting.

### Assignments for March 7

  * Picking up with the county population estimates file above, finish the exercise and commit it to Github.
  * Meet with your group to talk about potential ideas for your project. Remember, it could be a bot like CongressEdits or Mockingjay, or it could be a process for automating the analysis of data like we've done with Agate & Jupyter notebook. Or it could be something else entirely, as long as it is a system of some kind that automates a task. Each group will be listed [here](https://github.com/orgs/smpa3193-projects/teams). Create a repository in your group and call it `group-{number}-ideas`, and add a text file summarizing your discussions so far.
