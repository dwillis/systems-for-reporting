### Python and the command line

  * Log into [PythonAnywhere](https://www.pythonanywhere.com) and start a bash shell.
  * [Getting Started](https://ireapps.github.io/pycar/pycar_intro.html#/)
  * [An Informal Introduction to Python](https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/introduction.html)
  * Create exercises repository on GitHub & clone into PythonAnywhere


### Assignments

  * Python/Command line: In your PythonAnywhere bash shell in the exercises directory, copy and run the following commands:

      * `pip install virtualenvwrapper`
      * `mkvirtualenv exercises`
      * `pip install jupyter`
      * `pip install agate`
      * `pip install urllib3[secure] pyopenssl ndg-httpsclient pyasn1 requests`

      Then share your console with my email address using the "Share with others" button. You can close your browser tab now, but don't kill the console listed under "Your consoles" on the "Consoles" tab of PythonAnywhere.

  * Read [Introducing Agate](https://source.opennews.org/articles/introducing-agate/)
  * Read [Scooped by Code](http://www.niemanlab.org/2013/12/scooped-by-code/)
  * Send me, by email, 2 or 3 topics/subjects you're interested in with a data component (or a possible one).
