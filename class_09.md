### Assignments

  * Python: Follow along with Exercises [11](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/ex11.html) through 15 in Learn Python the Hard Way. Make files called `ex11.py` through `ex15.py` and upload them to your Exercises repository.
  * Read [Web Scraping: A Journalist's Guide](http://gijn.org/2015/08/11/web-scraping-a-journalists-guide/)
  * Final Projects: Make a sample of what your data will look like. Don't worry if you have to do it manually at this point; just have a CSV (or JSON) file(s) of the data that you'll be working with. You should upload it to your team's Github.
