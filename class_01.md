#### Assignments for Jan. 19

  * Read: [A fundamental way newspaper sites need to change](http://www.holovaty.com/writing/fundamental-change/) & be prepared to discuss.
  * Spreadsheet: Take 3 professors from [here](https://smpa.gwu.edu/faculty-directory) and, using the information on their detail pages, make a spreadsheet in which each row is one faculty member and the columns are whatever information you think is useful or helpful to know. Try to have one piece of information per column. There's no _right_ answer to this; I just want to see how you approach it. Email the spreadsheet (or provide a link if it's a Google Sheets file) to me before 11:10 a.m. on 1/19.
  * Make sure you have administrative rights on your laptop so you can install software. Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/), [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (only if you have a Windows laptop - Mac OS comes with it) and sign up for a free account at [PythonAnywhere](https://www.pythonanywhere.com/).
