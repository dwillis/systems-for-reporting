#### Introduction

  * Quiz!
  * Discussion on Life, Death and Netflix
  * What does a scraper do? Let's look at a [bill](http://mgaleg.maryland.gov/webmga/frmMain.aspx?stab=01&pid=billpage&tab=subject3&ys=2016rs&id=SB02).

#### Reading

  * [Finding Stories in the Structure of Data](https://source.opennews.org/en-US/learning/finding-stories-structure-data/)
  * [The Words That Were Used](http://www.nytimes.com/ref/washington/20070123_STATEOFUNION.html)

#### Exercise

  * Using this [Senate committee assignment roster](http://www.senate.gov/general/committee_assignments/assignments.htm), can you reorganize a few rows of this in Excel so that it is more useful, so that you can ask specific questions of it? We'll upload it to GitHub, too. Then let's take a look at [this](http://www.senate.gov/general/committee_membership/committee_memberships_SSAF.xml).
  * [Play by play](http://www.umterps.com//ViewContent.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=29700&CONTENT_ID=1632863)

#### Now You Try

  * Using the [Web Frequency Indexer](http://www.lextutor.ca/freq/eng/) and Excel, calculate the frequency of words used in the ["I Have a Dream" speech](http://www.americanrhetoric.com/speeches/mlkihaveadream.htm). Upload the Excel file to GitHub.
  * Let's visualize that using [in-cell bar graphs](http://infosthetics.com/archives/2006/08/excel_in_cell_graphing.html).
  * Do the same for the text of this [2009 Senate speech by Sen. Jim Inhofe](http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/22/senate-section/article/s9648-2/). Copy the results into Excel. Then do an in-cell bar chart like we did in class, using the REPT() function, and calculate the percent of total words that each word represents. Upload the Excel file to GitHub
