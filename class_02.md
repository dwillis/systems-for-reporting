#### Introduction

  * Terminal redux
  * Discussion on SMPA professor data
  * Discussion on [How Newspaper Websites Need to Change](http://www.holovaty.com/writing/fundamental-change/)

#### Exercise

  * Using this [Senate committee assignment roster](http://www.senate.gov/general/committee_assignments/assignments.htm), can you reorganize a few rows of this in Excel so that it is more useful, so that you can ask specific questions of it? We'll upload it to GitHub, too. Then let's take a look at [this](http://www.senate.gov/general/committee_membership/committee_memberships_SSAF.xml).

#### Now You Try

  * Using the [Web Frequency Indexer](http://www.lextutor.ca/freq/eng/) and Excel, calculate the frequency of words used in the ["I Have a Dream" speech](http://www.americanrhetoric.com/speeches/mlkihaveadream.htm). Upload the Excel file to GitHub.
  * Let's visualize that using [in-cell bar graphs](http://infosthetics.com/archives/2006/08/excel_in_cell_graphing.html).

#### Assignments for Jan. 24

  * Read [Finding Stories in the Structure of Data](https://source.opennews.org/en-US/learning/finding-stories-structure-data/)
  * Read [Data State of Mind](https://mjwebster.github.io/DataJ/Other/DataStateofMind/DataStateofMind.pdf)
  * Using the [Web Frequency Indexer](http://www.lextutor.ca/freq/eng/) and Excel, calculate the frequency of words used in this [2009 Senate speech by Sen. Jim Inhofe](http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/22/senate-section/article/s9648-2/). Copy the results into Excel/Google Sheets. Then do an in-cell bar chart like we did in class, using the REPT() function, and calculate the percent of total words that each word represents. Email the Excel file to dwillis@gwu.edu.
