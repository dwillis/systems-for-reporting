  * Excel: Download [this CSV of West Virginia 2012 general election results](http://services.sos.wv.gov/apps/elections/results/readfile.aspx?eid=13&type=StateCountyTotals&format=csv) and copy OFFICIAL county-level results (the file contains both official and unofficial results, look for a column that indicated that) for President Obama and Joe Manchin (U.S. Senate race) into a separate sheet, so that each county is a row and the columns contain the vote totals and percentages for both candidates (you'll have columns with names like County, ObamaVotes, TotalVotes and ObamaPct, and ManchinVotes, TotalSenateVotes and ManchinPct). Be sure to save your file as an XLS file, not a CSV, then answer these questions:

  1. In which counties did President Obama receive his highest and lowest percentages?
  2. How many counties did President Obama receive less than 50% of the vote?
  3. What was the largest difference in the number of votes between Manchin and Obama? Which county?
  4. What was the largest percentage difference between Manchin and Obama? Which county?
  5. Did President Obama receive a larger percentage of the vote than Manchin in any counties? Which ones?

  Put the saved Excel file and your answers (in a file called wv_answers.txt) in your Github repository.
